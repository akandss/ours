                was you checking before hand to see if there was vegetarian options, especially other than just a salad before hand.
                It's the small things that matter, and that really made me feel seen because I didn't even have to voice it. You just knew.

                This day was special for many reasons. When the opportunity came up to go pick up your keys I knew instantly
                that I wanted to do something special before you moved in. There was a day where I was walking in the park near
                my house and you were walking in your neighborhood and we talked about what we both like and what our comfort foods were.
                I didn't think that would come in handy so quickly, but using that I was able to put together a small surprise for you 
                and it was even more special that I got to fly to Spokane to keep you company on the drive over.

                were shocked that it came out. The emotions I was feeling in that momemnt is indescribable, it was like a mixture of shock,

                needed time to be certain and process everything before I said it. Like you, I was also thinking what is the right time
                and then at 4 am it just felt like that was the right time, and it definitely led to some amazing memories afterwards 😏

                In the middle of the 17th and 18th was when I told you I loved you at like 4 am. It had been on my mind all day, and I was
                very certain at that point that I loved you. I think when you told me in the car, I was already pretty certain but I 
                needed time to be certain and process everything before I said it. Like you, I was also thinking what is the right time
                and then at 4 am it just felt like that was the right time, and it definitely led to some amazing memories afterwards 😏
