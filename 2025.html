                was you checking before hand to see if there was vegetarian options, especially other than just a salad before hand.
                It's the small things that matter, and that really made me feel seen because I didn't even have to voice it. You just knew.

                This day was special for many reasons. When the opportunity came up to go pick up your keys I knew instantly
                that I wanted to do something special before you moved in. There was a day where I was walking in the park near
                my house and you were walking in your neighborhood and we talked about what we both like and what our comfort foods were.
                I didn't think that would come in handy so quickly, but using that I was able to put together a small surprise for you 
                and it was even more special that I got to fly to Spokane to keep you company on the drive over.

                were shocked that it came out. The emotions I was feeling in that momemnt is indescribable, it was like a mixture of shock,

                needed time to be certain and process everything before I said it. Like you, I was also thinking what is the right time
                and then at 4 am it just felt like that was the right time, and it definitely led to some amazing memories afterwards 😏

                Our first of many more times eating at indian nepali kitchen, but it was definitely an adventure before we landed there.
                I always believe everything happens for a reason though, because all that frustration we experienced in capitol hill trying
                to find parking to go to Annapurna made the food 10 times better and became our favorite place to eat. This day was also 
                really special because before leaving you had surprised me with royce chocolate, that too a flavor I hadn't tried, 
                because I had mentioned being pretty stressed earlier in the week too with work. It was just very thoughtful and meaningful and 
                finishing the day with eating nepali food with you and then going to mini golf at flat stick was an amazing day filled with
                lots of happiness and appreciation for you.

                This was a day where I was annoyed at you because I felt like you weren't getting any of your work done, and your scholarship
                essays were due soon, so while you worked on them (or pretended to, because I know you were watching youtube too) I was 
                working and then after a certain point we were like lets go to golden gardens for sunset, and wow parking really sucks in seattle
                because this is the second time it took forever to find parking in 2 days. Eventually we finally found parking, but we only stayed 
                for like 30 minutes 😂 and then we decided to go back to indian nepali kitchen for dinner, and this was the first time I had my 
                own Jhol Momo. 😋

                Our first time at Bamboo Sushi together, I remember this was one of the restaurants I said I wanted to take you before
                and you gave me shit then saying "wow so you only want to take me to one" 😒. That's besides the point though right now.
                I wanted to walk through campus but then found out the path I used to take was blocked off for construction so I took 
                us on a detour, but you know what we got to see mount ranier on the way and it was a pretty view so lets say it was all for
                the plot. We had some good sushi, and then we went to get hello robin for the first time. We got these orange habenero cookies
                and they were so good. Afterwards we went home and ate some yummy mangos and watermelong and played some poker with beer 
                to finish the night.

                you went and picked up indian nepali food for us all and then came to join the photoshoot, and then both of you bullied me
                the whole night which was rude 😑, but I was glad you and my brother got along and it was chill. We went to eat momos at your place
                but your roommates had people over so then we just went back to my brother's place and ate there and played some cards.

                This was the first time I cooked for you, and it was something that I love to cook so it was special sharing that with you.
                I remember you came after a ivy event (I think? or some event) after some strong drinks, and it was felt good to be the one
                to cook for you for once and that too on your vegetarian day 🤣, and it was even better when you enjoyed it
                (well so you said, who knows the lies you be telling). After that, I had bought 4 different Van Leeuwen ice creams because
                they were 50% off so we made a fruit plate with strawberries and mangos and then a scoop of all 4 ice creams. So, all in all
                a true feast.

                One of my favorite things that we did in the summer was definitely playing tennis with you. It was a great way to get outside
                and get some excercise in beautiful weather but also just enjoying time with you. It also felt satisfying to see the progress
                from when we started to when we last played, and of course we are both comopetitive so we have to play some matches 🎾. After 
                tennis today, we had lune which was definitely soo good and so worth it, and we probably ate all the calories we just burned and more
                but that's ok.

                Our first movie date was to go watch the F1 movie, and it was such a good movie. We even found the really good store next to the AMC
                that sold cheap sour candy stuff and snacks, so it was the perfect location. We also had indian nepali right before the movie, which 
                is very on point for us, becauase at this point we were regulars.

                This definitely was not the first time cooking red curry, but I think this was one of the better times that we cooked it. I always
                loved (still do) cooking and eating with you, it just felt right. I think red curry was like our go to for cooking because it was 
                easy to make vegetarian and pretty tasty, and usually there was leftovers. We cooked this right after tennis too so it was definitely
                late when we ate but it was soo good.

                This was so random but so fun, it was sooo hot though. I think it was like 90 degrees, but you taught me how to play some golf
                and you are always a good teacher. I remember the guy next to us was impressed especially when we went to the greens 
                and also what he was thinking when i was kneeling down and you were trying to help me 😏. This was a fun time just hitting the balls,

                After every vacation I take, we somehow end up back here. We went to go pick up your macbook today at best buy and still
                can't believe they made you erase your device in person. I had just gotten back from South Africa today and you came and picked
                up me and my brother (which  you never let me say no) and then of course we went to indian nepali for dinner and got thalis.

                I got to take you and Sonia to the 3 course meal on my work campus for the first time, which was something that I had on 
                our things to do while you are in Seattle (the list I made when you were in Spokane). You took your mental health day so that 
                you could spend it with us which made for a great day overall. I also got my final feedback from my manager this day so it was
                definitely a day to celebrate. For once, we were both dressed up equally and it was a vibe, and it was so fun seeing you enjoy the
                food, you always have the best reactions to when you enjoy and try the food for the first time. Afterwards, we took a little stroll
                around the Microsoft campus too and saw some treehouses before we were off to our next adventure.

                This is probably one of the most boujee things we could do in Seattle, and I'm glad I got to show it to you, I figured you would
                definitely love this place because one it has amazing views and two it involves some golf and its like country club vibes. This was
                one of my favorite spots I got to discover thanks to Microsoft and I wanted to share that with you. Of course like the amazing, patient
                person you are, you taught sonia how to play and read the greens and she still talks about that experience and how much fun she had 
                and that she got to truly learn what reading the greens meant. You truly amaze me in how patient you are and how great you are at explaining 
                things to people.

                After you finished up your nepali event, you came to grab some drinks with Cathy,Sonia, and I, but of course not before you took the wrong
                turn and ended up detouring because the mariners baseball game was going on. We took some G7X photos, chatted, some some weird groups 
                surrounding us and vibed. Then we went back to mine and just ended up talking for a long time, and of course you are always the sweetest
                and dropped Cathy back home so she wouldn't have to uber.

                I think Dominion was definitely one of my favorite things you introduced me, and we were so addicted to playing
                for a while and we bought all the expansions you didn't have. We were playing with plunder in this one which is probably
                one of our favorite expansions because it just goes so well with others or it can standalone too and it's still fun.

                I think this is the first time that you saw me eat so fast, and suppposedly it was obvious to you that I was hungry because
                I had low patience and I was annoyed (I still don't believe you but yk it's fine). The food was really good and I was pretty 
                hungry. We ended up buying Renaisance at a board game store before we went to get dinner and you even parked in front of a fire
                hydrant just so we could get the food quicker and not have to spend so long trying to find parking like we did for the board game store.
